# This is a prototype of the game I've created with a group of friends.

It's the first time I ever properly sat down with friends and decided to make a game. It's not finished, but some mechanics were already implemented.

In the process of development I've learned a lot of different implementations of the same mechanic. I decided to take the mathematic approach to spawning random planets around the player in selected area and also if a planet gets out of the players' range it gets automatically removed to save up space.

Even though it was an early stage of development, I decided to implement a binary encoder based save and load system.
